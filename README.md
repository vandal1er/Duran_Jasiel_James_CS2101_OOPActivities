# CS 211 - Object Oriented Programming Activities
---
This repository contains a collection of exercises and graded activities from the CS 211 Object-Oriented Programming course. The exercises aim to teach fundamental OOP concepts, including Input/Output, Functions, Arrays, Flow Control, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.

### Course Overview
__CS 211 introduces students to core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming, focusing on:__
- Input and Output
- Functions and Arrays
- Flow Control
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation

This repository contains various exercises designed to provide hands-on experience with these principles.

### Exercises and Activities
#### 1. Introduction: Input and Output
**GettingGreater.java**: A simple program that takes two characters as input and displays the character with the higher ASCII value.

**GettingInputs.java**: A program that takes song details *(e.g., song name, artist)* and prints them with style✨.


#### 2. Functions, Arrays, and Flow Control
**GetArrayMean.java**: A function that takes an array of numbers as input and computes and displays the mean of the array.

**MultiplicationTable.java**: A program that asks for a table size and prints the multiplication table for that size.


#### 3 and 4. The Principles of OOP
**'Shapes'**: A multi-file program highlighting Abstraction and Polymorphism. This program uses an interface to declare different shape types *(e.g., Triangle, Rectangle)* and allows users to interact with them using a common entry-point.

**'Artist Demo'**: Another multi-file program focusing on Encapsulation and Inheritance. It shows how generalized objects *(e.g., an Artist class)* can be built on upon by specialized objects *(e.g., Painter, Writer)* using inheritance, and encapsulating details like the artist’s name, style, and artwork.


#### Other Exercises
Various light exercises covering topics like Encapsulation, Escape Sequences, and Basic Input/Output operations.
